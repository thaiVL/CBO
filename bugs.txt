Nov 22 - navbar not collapsing.
    Fix: only load scripts on a single page, so remove script for jquery and stuff as well as bootstrap css and stuff for header
        and footer. Doing this fixes the navbar not collapsing.
        So now, header and footer will look ugly by itself, but when loaded into the core html files, it'll look normal
        and pretty.

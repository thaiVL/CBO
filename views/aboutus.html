                    <p>We don't judge, we just help those who need it. We are a non-profit organization that began in Canada
                        with a group of friends who were passionate about helping those who are less fortunate. At the beginning, we were only
                        a group of 5 friends that were helping out our local community. Over time, we expanded and started an organization so that
                        we can reach out and help others who are in farther communities than our local area. We only want to see the smile
                        on those who we've help. Now, we are an organization that has several branches across the world, and able to offer help in
                        many areas other than only shelter and food.
